# George's Prework Study Guide

## Description

This repo is for my prework study guide. It contains notes about different things I have learnt in my prework. Each section is broken down so I have an area for HTML, Git, JavaScript and CSS. 

I created this site as a place to collect my notes from my bootcamp prework. It keeps everything together in an easy to access place.
